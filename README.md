# 357 Case Study

The goal of this project is to use UI/UX concepts to explore
how we can design a mobile application that helps the elderly.

We used a combination of low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes
which helped us in different ways.

Low-fidelity prototypes such as wireframes helped us get our thoughts onto "paper" quickly which helped us communicate our ideas in the early stages of design.

High-fidelity prototypes such as mockups helped us see what our actual final product might look like.

User personas also helped us better design our application because
it forced us to think about our userbase first before anything else.
